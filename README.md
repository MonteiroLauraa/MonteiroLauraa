**👋 Hi there!
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at PUC Minas University. I'm passionate about technology and always looking to grow as a developer, especially in the backend field.

🗣 I hold a B2 English proficiency certified by the FCE (First Certificate in English). I'm also learning Deutsch (German) and LIBRAS (Brazilian Sign Language) to broaden my communication skills.

💻 I'm particularly interested in building and improving backend projects, and I'm constantly learning new tools, languages, and best practices in software development.

♟️ When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me playing chess, working out, or going for a run.

Feel free to connect or check out my projects!
